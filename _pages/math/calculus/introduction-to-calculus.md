Calculus is the study of change. It is a branch of mathematics that deals with the study of rates of change and accumulation. Calculus is divided into two main branches: differential calculus and integral calculus. Differential calculus deals with the study of rates of change, while integral calculus deals with the study of accumulation.

Calculus is an essential tool in many fields, including physics, engineering, economics, and computer science. It is also widely used in quantitative finance, where it is used to model and analyze financial markets.

In this course, we will cover the basics of calculus, including limits, derivatives, and integrals. We will also cover more advanced topics, such as multivariable calculus and partial derivatives.

Whether you are new to calculus or looking to refresh your knowledge, this course is designed to help you understand the fundamental concepts of calculus and how they are applied in practice.
