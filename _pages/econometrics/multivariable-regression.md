Comparing to univariable regression, multivariable regression is adding more independent variables to the model. The model is still linear, but the number of independent variables is more than one. The model is as follows:

$$
Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_1 + \beta_2X_2 + \ldots + \beta_nX_n + \epsilon,
$$

where:
- $Y$ is the dependent variable,
- $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$ are independent variables,
- $\beta_0, \beta_1, \beta_2, \ldots, \beta_n$ are coefficients,
- $\epsilon$ is the error term.
