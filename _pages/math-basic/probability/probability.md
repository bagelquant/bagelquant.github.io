Probability is the mathematics of uncertainty. For quantitative finance, it is as fundamental as calculus and linear algebra: every model of risk, return, and pricing is ultimately a probabilistic statement about the future.

This series is designed as a **complete, beginner-friendly probability course** tailored to future quants. We build the theory carefully from first principles but constantly tie ideas back to intuition and financial applications: returns, risk, factor models, and derivatives pricing.
