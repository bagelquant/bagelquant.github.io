Calculus is the basic mathematical tool for modeling continuous change.  

In quantitative finance, it underpins derivative pricing, risk management, and dynamic optimization â€” from computing sensitivities (Greeks) to modeling stochastic processes in continuous time.

For math basics series, calculus, probability, and linear algebra form the essential triad. They serve as the foundation for more advanced topics like stochastic calculus, optimization, and statistical inference. This site assumes familiarity with these fundamentals. Below are quick reviews of key concepts in calculus.
