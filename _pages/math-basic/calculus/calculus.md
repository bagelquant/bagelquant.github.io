Calculus is the mathematical foundation of continuous change. In quantitative finance, it underpins everything from derivative pricing and risk management to dynamic portfolio optimization.

This series is designed to be a comprehensive course for beginners, building the concepts of calculus from the ground up. We will cover single-variable, multivariable, and vector calculus, with a focus on building intuition and providing context for financial applications.

### Part 1: The Foundations of Calculus

- [Introduction to Calculus: The Mathematics of Change](introduction-to-calculus.md)
- [Limits and Continuity: The Foundation of Calculus](limits-and-continuity.md)
- [The Derivative: Measuring Instantaneous Change](derivatives.md)
- [Applications of Differentiation](applications-of-differentiation.md)

### Part 2: Integration and Infinite Series

- [The Integral: Accumulating Change](integrals.md)
- [Techniques of Integration](techniques-of-integration.md)
- [Applications of Integration](applications-of-integration.md)
- [Sequences and Series: The Path to Infinity](sequences-and-series.md)
- [Power and Taylor Series: Approximating Functions](power-and-taylor-series.md)

### Part 3: Multivariable and Vector Calculus

- [Vectors and the Geometry of Space](vectors-and-geometry-of-space.md)
- [Partial Derivatives and Gradients](partial-derivatives.md)
- [Applications of Partial Derivatives](applications-of-partial-derivatives.md)
- [Multiple Integrals](multiple-integrals.md)
- [Vector Calculus](vector-calculus.md)

Calculus provides the language and tools to analyze how financial quantities evolve continuously, enabling precise modeling and effective decision-making in dynamic markets. These fundamentals are essential for more advanced topics such as:
