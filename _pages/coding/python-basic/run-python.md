Now that we have installed Python, let's run Python scripts on your computer.

There are two ways to run Python scripts:

1. **Python Interpreter**: Run Python scripts line by line in the terminal.
2. **Python Script**: Run Python scripts as a whole. Then envoking the Python interpreter to run the script.

This is the universal way to run Python scripts on any operating system. Modern IDEs and code editors provide a more user-friendly interface, but they all use the Python interpreter in the background. They usually provide a **Run** button to execute the Python script. This article will focus on the universal way to run Python scripts. Hence, a better understanding of the Python interpreter is essential.

## Line by line with Python Interpreter

Steps:

1. Open the terminal.
2. **Activate the environment**: If you have created a new environment, activate it.
3. **Run Python**: Type `python` in the terminal and press `Enter`.
4. **Some python code**: Type `print("Hello, World!")` and press `Enter`.

You should see `Hello, World!` printed on the terminal.

> Note: **How to close the Python Interpreter?** Type `exit()` and press `Enter`.

## Run Python Script

Steps:

1. Create a new file with `.py` extension. For example, `hello.py`. 
  - If you are not familiar with terminal commands, you can first create a `.txt` file and then rename it to `.py`.
2. Write some Python code in the file. For example, `print("Hello, World!")`.
3. Open the terminal, and navigate to the directory where the file is located.
  - **Tip**: Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory.
  - For example, `cd Documents/Python`.
4. **Activate the environment**: If you have created a new environment, activate it.
5. **Run Python script**: Type `python hello.py` in the terminal and press `Enter`.
6. You should see `Hello, World!` printed on the terminal.

## Key Takeaways

- **Python Interpreter**: Run Python scripts line by line in the terminal.
- **Python Script**: Run Python scripts as a whole in the terminal.
