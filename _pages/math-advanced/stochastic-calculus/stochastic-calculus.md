Modeling price movements is central to quantitative finance. In [Derivatives](https://bagelquant.com/derivatives/), we saw how options depend on underlying asset prices that evolve randomly over time, we need tools to analyze these stochastic processes.

Modeling a **random process** / **random movement** first appears in physics, where particles move in unpredictable ways due to collisions with other particles. This phenomenon is called **Brownian motion** or **Wiener process**. In finance, we could consider stock prices as a similar mechanism, each transaction is a "collision" (buy or sell force) that causes the price to change randomly. This leads us to model stock prices as stochastic processes.

Topics in stochastic calculus include:
