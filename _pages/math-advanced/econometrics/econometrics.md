Econometrics applies statistical methods to economic data, serving as a vital branch of economics that provides empirical insights into economic relationships. It is a powerful tool for empirical research, enabling economists to test hypotheses, forecast outcomes, and make policy recommendations based on rigorous data analysis.

I was fortunate to study econometrics with **[Professor Mariya Naumova](https://www.business.rutgers.edu/faculty/mariya-naumova)** at Rutgers Business School. She is an exceptional teacher who brings depth and practicality to econometric topics, making complex concepts accessible and relevant.
