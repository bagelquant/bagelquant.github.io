Econometrics is the application of statistical methods to economic data, serving as a vital branch of economics that seeks to provide empirical insights into economic relationships. It functions as a powerful tool for empirical research, enabling economists to test hypotheses, forecast outcomes, and offer policy recommendations based on rigorous analysis of economic data.
I am fortunate to learn econometrics from **[Professor Mariya Naumova](https://www.business.rutgers.edu/faculty/mariya-naumova)** at Rutgers Business School. She is an exceptional teacher who delves into econometric topics with depth and practicality, making complex concepts accessible and relevant.

This topic also contains a practical component, where we will use Excel and R to implement econometric models and analyze real-world data.
