I am a **Quantitative Finance practitioner** graduating with a Master of Quantitative Finance from Rutgers Business School in **December 2025** (GPA 4.0). My expertise lies at the intersection of fundamental financial intuition and rigorous data science, where I build end-to-end research pipelines—from raw data engineering and factor design to robust backtesting, risk modeling, and portfolio construction.

Currently based in the NYC area, I am seeking opportunities in **Quantitative Research**, **Risk Management**, or **Portfolio Analytics**, where I can leverage my technical toolkit to drive actionable investment insights.

## Core Competencies

My approach combines clean, reproducible code with practical models designed to survive out-of-sample testing.

*   **Full-Stack Quant Workflow:** End-to-end execution of data ingestion, factor construction, signal forecasting, and portfolio optimization.
*   **Advanced Modeling:** Expertise in statistical methods (OLS, PCA, Time-Series), Machine Learning (Lasso/ENet, Random Forest, GBM), and Risk Analytics (VaR/CVaR, Stress Testing).
*   **Data Engineering:** Construction of robust ETL pipelines, SQL database management, and automated data quality assurance.
*   **Research Discipline:** Commitment to rigorous rolling validation, IC/IR diagnostics, and transparent experiment logging.

## Professional Experience

**Quant Analyst Intern | Quantel Asset Management**  
*New York, NY (Jun 2025 – Aug 2025)*

*   **Pipeline Architecture:** Led a team of three to architect and deliver a streamlined equity multi-factor research pipeline, covering signal construction, evaluation, backtesting, and optimization.
*   **Factor Research:** Reconstructed 170+ academic characteristics and curated ~80 candidate signals through rigorous IC/IR, OLS, and quantile analysis.
*   **Forecasting Models:** Developed return-forecasting models utilizing Lasso/ENet, Random Forest, and PCA-regression, validated through rolling-window and out-of-sample testing.

**Quant Developer | Sincere Digits**  
*Beijing, China (2022 – 2024)*

*   **System Development:** Directed a backend team in building a FastAPI-based fund research platform, featuring automated evaluation, recommendation engines, and backtesting capabilities.
*   **Performance Optimization:** Productionized ETL workflows and data quality checks, achieving a **65% reduction in runtime** through vectorization and SQL optimization.
*   **Risk Analytics:** Implemented comprehensive risk metrics (VaR/CVaR, Sharpe, Sortino, MaxDD) and traffic-light backtesting protocols.

**Quant Analyst & Project Manager | Hongchou Investment**  
*Beijing, China (2021 – 2022)*

*   **Strategic Transition:** Spearheaded the firm's transition from fundamental to quantitative strategies, overseeing 5 portfolios with **~200M CNY AUM**.
*   **Analytics Infrastructure:** Built a proprietary fund scoring system using clustering and pattern mining, automating exposure and attribution reporting.
*   **Performance Attribution:** Implemented Brinson–Fachler attribution and tracking error analysis to support Portfolio Manager decision-making.

## Academic & Research Projects

*   **Analyst-Management Disagreement (Research Assistant):** Leveraging LLMs to measure sentiment divergence in earnings calls and analyzing its predictive power on trading volume, volatility, and returns (with Prof. Zhengzi “Sophia” Li, Rutgers).
*   **Risk-Timing Models:** Applying GARCH and LSTM models to forecast time-series volatility for factor portfolios, validated against RMSE/MAE and trading KPIs.
*   **Open Source Contributions:** 
    *   `bagel-factor`: A comprehensive factor evaluation pipeline on PyPI.
    *   `bagel-tushare`: A robust, multithreaded data ingestion tool for financial datasets.

## Technical Arsenal

| Domain | Tools & Technologies |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Programming** | Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch), C++, R, MATLAB, SQL |
| **Quant Modeling** | Fama-French Factors, Black-Scholes, Vasicek/Hull-White, Mean-Variance Optimization |
| **Risk & Validation** | VaR/CVaR (Historical/Parametric/MC), Stress Testing, Backtesting (Kupiec/Christoffersen) |
| **Machine Learning** | Linear Models (Lasso/Ridge), Tree-based (RF/GBM), Deep Learning (LSTM/NN) |
| **Development** | Git, Docker, Linux, VS Code, Neovim, LaTeX, Tableau |

## Professional Philosophy

I advocate for **simplicity and robustness** over fragile complexity. My goal is to deliver clarity—whether in code architecture, research design, or the communication of model outputs to stakeholders. I believe that rigorous validation and reliable data are the cornerstones of sustainable alpha.
