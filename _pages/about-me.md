## About Me

I am a **systematic investment researcher** focused on **equity factor investing and portfolio construction**, with experience building and validating quantitative strategies in real buy-side environments. My work emphasizes **out-of-sample robustness, turnover control, and drawdown-aware optimization**, ensuring that signals remain usable beyond backtests.

I build **production-ready quantitative research pipelines** spanning data engineering, factor design, signal evaluation, portfolio optimization, and performance attribution. Across asset management roles, I’ve learned that sustainable alpha comes not from model complexity, but from disciplined research design and a deep understanding of how strategies behave across market regimes.

I am currently completing a **Master of Quantitative Finance at Rutgers Business School** (GPA 4.0), graduating in **December 2025**, and I am based in the NYC area. I am seeking opportunities in **Asset Management** and **Quantitative Research** where rigor, clarity, and implementability are central to the investment process.

## Core Competencies

My research philosophy prioritizes robustness, interpretability, and implementability.

- **Systematic Investing & Factor Research**  
  Factor construction, signal evaluation, cross-sectional and time-series analysis, and portfolio optimization under realistic constraints (turnover, exposure, capacity).

- **Robust Research Design**  
  Rolling-window validation, IC/IR diagnostics, regime sensitivity analysis, and degradation testing to ensure signals survive out-of-sample.

- **Risk-Aware Portfolio Construction**  
  Drawdown analysis, stress testing, scenario analysis, and attribution used to inform portfolio decisions—not just reporting.

- **Production-Oriented Engineering**  
  Clean, reproducible Python code, automated ETL pipelines, SQL-backed analytics, and scalable research infrastructure.

## Professional Experience

### Quant Analyst Intern | Quantel Asset Management  
*New York, NY · Jun 2025 – Aug 2025*

- Built an **end-to-end equity multi-factor investment pipeline**, covering factor construction, signal evaluation, portfolio backtesting, and constrained optimization.
- Replicated and validated **170+ academic equity factors**, filtering to a stable subset using IC/IR analysis, regression diagnostics, monotonicity tests, and turnover controls.
- Evaluated linear, regularized, and tree-based models under rolling out-of-sample tests, prioritizing **robustness and stability over in-sample fit**.
- Analyzed drawdowns and volatility spikes to explain portfolio behavior under stressed market conditions.

### Quant Analyst | Hongchou Investment  
*Beijing, China · 2021 – 2022*

- Supported the firm’s transition from discretionary selection to **systematic, factor-driven fund allocation**, covering portfolios totaling **~200M CNY AUM**.
- Designed fund scoring and screening frameworks using clustering, pattern mining, and risk-adjusted metrics to maintain a continuously investable universe.
- Implemented **Brinson–Fachler attribution**, tracking error, and information ratio analysis to support portfolio manager decision-making.

### Quant Analyst | Sincere Digits  
*Beijing, China · 2022 – 2024*

- Built a **fund analytics and recommendation platform** supporting portfolio construction, evaluation, and risk-aware fund selection.
- Productionized ETL pipelines and data quality checks, achieving a **65% reduction in runtime** through vectorization and SQL optimization.
- Implemented portfolio performance and risk analytics, including VaR/CVaR, drawdown analysis, and stress testing.

## Academic & Research Projects

- **Analyst–Management Disagreement (Research Assistant)**  
  Applied LLM-based NLP techniques to earnings calls to measure disagreement between executives and analysts, linking signals to abnormal trading volume, volatility, and stock returns (with Prof. Zhengzi “Sophia” Li, Rutgers).

- **Volatility Forecasting & Risk Timing**  
  Developed GARCH-family and LSTM models to forecast volatility and evaluate risk-timing overlays for factor portfolios under rolling out-of-sample tests.

- **Open-Source Quant Research Tools**  
  - `bagel-factor`: A modular factor evaluation and validation pipeline published on PyPI.  
  - `bagel-tushare`: A multithreaded, production-ready data ingestion wrapper for financial datasets.

## Technical Arsenal

| Domain | Tools & Technologies |
|------|---------------------|
| **Programming** | Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn), C++, R, MATLAB, SQL |
| **Quant Modeling** | Factor Models, Portfolio Optimization, Monte Carlo Simulation, Term Structure Models |
| **Risk & Diagnostics** | Drawdown Analysis, Stress Testing, Scenario Analysis, Backtesting |

## Professional Philosophy

I believe the strongest investment strategies are **simple, explainable, and resilient**. My focus is not on maximizing backtest metrics, but on understanding **why a strategy works, when it fails, and how it behaves under stress**.

This site documents my work—projects, experiments, and ideas—centered on a single objective:  
**building systematic investment strategies that survive real markets.**
