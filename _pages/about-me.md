Hi, I‚Äôm **Yanzhong (Eric) Huang**‚Äîa quantitative finance practitioner who blends fundamental intuition with rigorous data science. I‚Äôm finishing my **Master of Quantitative Finance at Rutgers Business School (Dec 2025)** and I build research pipelines end-to-end: from data engineering and factor design to backtesting, risk, and portfolio construction. I care about clean code, reproducible research, and practical models that survive out-of-sample.

## Now

- üéì **MQF @ Rutgers** (GPA 4.0), graduating **December 2025**
- üîé Looking for roles in **Quant Research/Analytics**, **Risk/Model Validation**, or **Portfolio Analytics** (NYC preferred)
- üë®üèª‚Äçüíª Building reusable Python tooling for factor research and portfolio analytics

## What I bring

- **Full-stack quant workflow**: data ingestion/cleaning ‚Üí factor construction ‚Üí forecasting ‚Üí portfolio/risk ‚Üí reporting
- **Modeling toolkit**: statistical (OLS, PCA, time-series), ML (Lasso/ENet, RF/GBM, simple NN), risk (VaR/CVaR, stress tests)
- **Data engineering**: ETL pipelines, SQL databases, data quality checks, automated reporting
- **Research discipline**: rolling validation, IC/IR diagnostics, robust OOS tests, clear experiment logs
- **Communication**: translate models into portfolio decisions, attribution, and risk narratives for PMs & stakeholders

## Experience Highlights

**Quant Analyst Intern, Quantel Asset Management (NY, Jun‚ÄìAug 2025)**  

- Led a 3-intern team to deliver a streamlined **equity multi-factor research pipeline** (construction, evaluation, backtest, optimization) and used it to interpret client portfolio performance.  
- **Reconstructed 170+ academic characteristics**, ran IC/IR, OLS & quantile tests; curated **~80 candidate signals** plus macro predictors.  
- Built **return-forecasting** models (Lasso/ENet, Random Forest, PCA-regression, simple NN) with **rolling-window validation** and robust OOS testing.

**Quant Developer, Sincere Digits (Beijing, 2022‚Äì2024)**  

- Led a 4-person backend team building a **FastAPI** fund-research site (evaluation, recommendation, backtesting).  
- Productionized ETL and quality checks (SQL reconciliations, exception queues); vectorization **cut runtime ~65%**.  
- Implemented performance & risk analytics (Sharpe/Sortino/MaxDD, **VaR/CVaR** with historical & MC, traffic-light backtests).

**Quant Analyst ‚Üí PM, Hongchou Investment (Beijing, 2021‚Äì2022)**  

- Drove a **fundamental ‚Üí quant** transition; helped oversee **5 portfolios** (~200M CNY AUM).  
- Built a **fund scoring system** (clustering, pattern mining, risk-adjusted metrics) and automated exposure/attribution reports.  
- Implemented **Brinson‚ÄìFachler attribution**, TE/IR tracking, and IC/IR + attribution bridges for PM decks.

## Projects & Research

- **RA (with Prof. Zhengzi ‚ÄúSophia‚Äù Li, Rutgers, 2025‚Äì )**: LLM-based measurement of **analyst‚Äìmanagement disagreement** in earnings calls; link to volume, volatility, and returns.  
- **Time-Series Volatility for Risk-Timing**: GARCH family & LSTM overlays for factor portfolios; validated with RMSE/MAE and trading KPIs.  
- **Portfolio Exposure Dashboard**: maps Barra/Axioma styles, integrates **Greeks buckets** and vol-surface timers for overlay decisions.  
- **Open-source (PyPI)**: `bagel-factor` (factor evaluation pipeline) and `bagel-tushare` (robust, multithreaded data ingestion).

## Skills Snapshot

**Programming**: Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, PyQt), C++, R, MATLAB, VBA, Linux  
**Data/DB**: SQL, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy; clean ETL, reconciliations, QA checks  
**Quant Modeling**: Fama-French/factor research, **Vasicek/Hull‚ÄìWhite/Heston**, Black-Scholes, mean-variance & utility  
**Risk/Validation**: **VaR/CVaR** (hist/param/MC), stress & scenario, backtesting (Kupiec/Christoffersen), **SR 11-7** mindset  
**ML**: Lasso/ENet/Ridge/GLS, Random Forest/GBM, LSTM; feature engineering; cross-validation & drift monitoring  
**Tools**: Git/GitHub, VS Code/PyCharm, Vim/Neovim, Tableau, LaTeX; clean repos & reproducible notebooks

## Philosophy

I believe **simple, well-validated models** deployed with reliable data and thoughtful risk controls beat fragile complexity. My north star is **clarity**‚Äîin code, in research design, and in how model outputs inform portfolio decisions.
