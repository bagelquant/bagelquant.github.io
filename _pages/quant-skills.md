A career in quantitative finance is a fusion of mathematics, programming, and finance. 
It demands not only a foundational understanding of these disciplines 
but also familiarity with cutting-edge technologies and methodologies. 
As technology evolves rapidly, so do the skills required in the quant field. 
Mastering this combination of competencies is crucial for success in a quant career.

In this page, I will explore essential quantitative skills, 
ranging from basic to advanced levels, and cover key areas relevant to this profession. 
I am currently pursuing a [Master of Quantitative Finance at Rutgers Business School](https://www.business.rutgers.edu/masters-quantitative-finance). 
The topics discussed here draw from both my studies and my professional experience. I hope you find this information valuable.
