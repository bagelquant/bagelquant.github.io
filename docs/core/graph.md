# Graph

## Overview

`Graph` represents a lazy chain of research logic.

```python
price = Panel.from_domain(price_df, domain, name="price")
signal = rank(zscore(price), name="signal")
```

The raw input is a `Panel`. The derived signal is a `Graph`.

## Responsibility

Graph manages:

- Logic-chain outputs
- Dependency collection
- DAG validation
- Topological ordering
- Graph specifications
- Runtime delegation
- Materialized output access

Validation rejects cycles, duplicate node names, invalid parent types, and
operation nodes with an invalid number of parents.

Graph does not store raw input frames and does not contain domain-specific
operation methods.

## Output

Before execution, output access raises an error:

```python
signal.output
```

After execution, `Graph.output` is a panel:

```python
signal.compute()
signal_panel = signal.output
```

Computing a downstream graph also populates outputs for evaluated intermediate
graphs.

## Multi-Output Graphs

```python
strategy = Graph(outputs=[signal, prediction])
strategy.compute()
outputs = strategy.output
```

For a multi-output graph, `output` is a mapping from output name to panel.
