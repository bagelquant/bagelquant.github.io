# Concepts

## DataSource

`DataSource` isolates provider access behind `read`, `exists`, and `describe`.
Adapters live in `bagelquant_data.datasource` and consume `DataRequest` objects
so callers do not depend on provider-specific client APIs.

## Loader

`Loader` coordinates requests and returns standardized `LoadedDataset` objects.
When configured with a lake, it reads local lake snapshots first and only hits a
provider for bootstrap or explicit refresh.

## Data Lake Manager

`DataLakeManager` owns add, edit, delete, list, and manual provider updates for
the local lake.

Each source's first configured table is its universe-like reference table. For
Tushare, this is `stock_basic`, refreshed from listed, delisted, and paused
stocks to avoid survivorship bias.

## Transform

Transforms are stateless DataFrame operations that can be chained with
`Transform`.

## Metadata

Metadata exists independently of data. Contracts describe dataset identity,
schema, freshness, ownership, version, and lineage.

## Data Lake

Lake storage is separated by data source, table, year, and month. Writes create
immutable snapshots and update latest pointers at the table and partition level.
Every stored table has a `date` index plus `create_time` and `delete_flag`
columns. The lake also maintains source-local asset and field id tables.
Reference tables that are not panel-like, such as `stock_basic`, keep their
ordinary row index while still receiving lifecycle columns.

Use `LocalDataLake.read` for direct table reads, `read_panel_field` for
date-by-asset panels, `fields` for field catalogs, and `asset_ids` for source
asset catalogs.

## Cache

Cache interfaces are optional and should not change dataset identity or
reproducibility guarantees.
