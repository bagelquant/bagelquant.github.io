```

The normal path is provider to local lake to user. `Loader` reads from the local
lake first when configured. Provider access is used for bootstrap and refresh.
All operations are exposed as backend Python APIs; there is no GUI layer in this
package.

The package keeps provider access, metadata, transformation, and storage
interfaces independent. Local V1 storage uses source/table/year/month Parquet
snapshots with JSON metadata, while the interfaces leave room for future
Iceberg, Delta, object storage, or cloud backends.

```text
lake-root/
  tushare/
    daily/
      year=2024/
        month=01/
          snapshots/
```

Reads can project columns and filter dates at the lake boundary. `LocalDataLake`
uses partition metadata to skip snapshots outside the requested range, then
applies exact date filtering after reading. This keeps the API simple while
reducing IO for common panel-field and date-window reads.

The lake maintains source-level system catalogs for asset ids and field ids.
Table catalog metadata records inferred date, asset, and panel field columns so
`read_panel_field` can load only the requested field plus the minimum date and
asset columns needed to shape a date-by-asset panel.

## Dependency Direction

`bagelquant-data` is below downstream repositories. It must not import
`bagelquant-core`, `bagelquant-bt`, `bagelquant-app`, or documentation sites.

The communication boundary with `bagelquant-core` is plain retrieved data.
`RetrievedPanel` exposes pandas data, universe, and sorted calendar objects,
leaving downstream code responsible for creating `Domain`, `Panel`, and
`CategoryPanel` without coupling the packages.

## Tushare Update Specs

Provider updates are described with `TushareTableUpdateSpec`. A spec keeps a
table's kind, update-universe reference, and trading calendar reference in one object,
which avoids parallel argument maps drifting apart. The manager scans specs into
a dry-run `TushareUpdateReport`, and execution consumes only the confirmed jobs
from that report.

## Module Structure

- `datasource` owns provider adapters, requests, and source registration.
- `lake` owns local storage, snapshot catalogs, direct reads, and update
  orchestration.
- `loader` owns lake-first retrieval and plain panel-shaped return objects.
- `metadata` owns schemas, contracts, identities, and lineage records.
- `transform` owns stateless DataFrame transformation pipelines.
- `cache` owns optional cache policies and implementations.
