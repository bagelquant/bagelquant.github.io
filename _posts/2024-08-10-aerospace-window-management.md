Aerospace is new window management tool I tried. It is a tile based window manager for MacOS. It is similar to i3 for Linux. It is a great tool for managing windows on MacOS.

## Installation

```shell
brew install --cask nikitabobko/tap/aerospace
```

## Configuration

Aerospace is configured using a toml file. The default configuration file is located at `~/.config/aerospace/aerospace.toml`. You can edit this file to customize the behavior of Aerospace.

## Usage

Here is a great video made by Josean Martinez on how to use Aerospace.
