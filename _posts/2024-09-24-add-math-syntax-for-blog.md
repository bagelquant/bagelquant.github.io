I noticed that the Minimal Mistakes theme does not support Math syntax by default. I want to add Math syntax to my Github page.

After some research, I find a great post on how to add Math syntax to the Minimal Mistakes theme Github page. The article is written by [Minjeong Choi](https://choimon.github.io/about/).

Here is her post: [How to use Latex(MathJax) on Minimal Mistakes Github blogs](https://choimon.github.io/blog/mathjax-for-minimalmistakes-githubpage/#1-set-the-markdown-engine)
