title: "bagelquant 2.0 — From Mistake Minimal to a Custom Local Theme"
layout: post
---
 
BagelQuant start from a remote Jekyll theme called "[Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/)" created by Michael Rose. It is a brilliant, free template that provides a suite of features and layouts for building static sites with Jekyll. Over time, however, I found myself needing more control over the design and functionality of the site, leading to the decision to migrate to a fully local, custom theme.

In particular, I wanted to:

- Eliminate dependencies on external resources for better performance and reliability.
- A dark mode!
- Customize the layout and styles to better fit my content and branding.

Now excited to announce: bagelquant 2.0 is live — a switch from the remote "Minimal Mistakes" theme to a fully local, custom Jekyll theme tailored specifically for bagelquant.

-What’s new in bagelquant 2.0

- Local theme: All layouts, includes, and assets are now in-repo for immediate edits and full control.
- Faster, reproducible builds: No remote_theme dependency — builds work offline and are deterministic.
- Local KaTeX math rendering: KaTeX CSS/JS are bundled in `assets/` for consistent, fast math rendering.
- Improved search: `search.json` and client-side search updated to match the new markup for better accuracy.
- Better code highlighting: Theme now ships tuned styles for code blocks and inline code for improved readability.
- Privacy & performance: Removed external calls where possible, leading to fewer third-party requests.

> Some visual changes may still need tweaking. However, I am excited about the new direction and the flexibility it provides for future enhancements.

Check out the new dark theme, looks great on both desktop and mobile!
