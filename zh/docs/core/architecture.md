# BagelQuant Core Architecture

## Overview

BagelQuant separates concrete panel data from lazy graph logic.

```text
Panel inputs
    |
    v
Transformer and Composer functions
    |
    v
Graph logic chains
    |
    v
Internal execution runtime
    |
    v
Cached Panel outputs
```

## Panel

A `Panel` is an immutable numeric frame indexed by time and asset. Every input
is normalized through a `Domain`, which owns its trading sessions and asset
membership. Panels return a defensive copy through `Panel.data`.

```python
price = Panel.from_domain(price_df, domain, name="price")
```

Panels are DAG leaves and execution outputs.

## Graph

A `Graph` represents lazy derived logic:

```python
bm_ratio = div(book, price, name="bm_ratio")
bm_factor = rank(zscore(bm_ratio), name="bm_factor")
```

Graph responsibilities:

- Collect dependencies
- Validate DAG structure
- Expose reproducible specs
- Delegate execution
- Expose the materialized `output` panel after execution

Graph does not own domain operations or raw input data.

## Transformer Functions

A transformer is unary:

```text
Panel | Graph -> Graph
```

```python
signal = rank(raw_factor, name="signal")
```

Custom transformers use `@transformer`.

## Composer Functions

A composer accepts one or more inputs:

```text
(Panel | Graph, ...) -> Graph
```

```python
bm_ratio = div(book, price, name="bm_ratio")
```

Custom composers use `@composer`.

## Internal Nodes

Calling an operation creates an internal node that stores:

- Parent nodes
- Qualified operation name
- Serializable configuration
- Node name and metadata
- Cached output panel after execution

Users do not construct internal nodes directly.

## Execution

Calling `Graph.compute()` invokes an internal runtime that recursively
evaluates dependencies, checks multi-input Domain compatibility, computes
deterministic cache keys, caches output panels during execution, and updates
node outputs. Dynamic membership masks are reapplied to derived outputs.
Within one runtime invocation, shared DAG nodes are evaluated once. When
composer inputs are already aligned, the runtime reuses the existing frames
and their stored hashes.

```python
signal.compute()
panel = signal.output
```

Scheduling is sequential in the current implementation. Parallel scheduling,
persisted caches, and incremental invalidation remain future work.
